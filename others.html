  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Agni IV</td>
    <td>Two stage missile powered by solid propellant. Can fire from a road mobile launcher. Range is more than 3,500 km. Equipped with indigenously developed ring laser gyro and composite rocket motor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Agni V</td>
    <td>Three-stage solid fueled, indigenous Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). Capable of carrying 1.5 tonnes of nuclear warheads. Latest and most advanced variant in terms of navigation and guidance, warhead and engine. Canister launches missile system for operational flexibility. Range is more than 5,000 km.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Agni P</td>
    <td>Canisterised missile with range capability between 1,000 and 2,000 km. Many advanced technologies including composites, propulsion systems, innovative guidance and control mechanisms and state-of-the-art navigation systems have been introduced. The missile would further strengthen India's credible deterrence capabilities.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Trishul</td>
    <td>Short-range, quick reaction, all weather surface-to-air missile designed to counter a low level attack. Has necessary electronic counter-measures against all known aircraft jammers.</td>
